    "Indexes allow Oracle to locate rows quickly without scanning the entire table. However, indexing may not be effective in scenarios involving columns with low cardinality (e.g., gender) or highly dynamic data that undergoes frequent updates or deletions, as these can result in increased maintenance overhead or minimal performance improvement.\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Speeds up query execution.\n",
    "- **Implementation:** Create indexes on columns frequently used in WHERE clauses, joins, or sorting."
